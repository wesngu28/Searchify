Why am I not using vite-plugin-ssr?

Because next.js interests me more at the moment and vite was more of a spa development thing for me

sha f7f0fb5ceaa8003d35e95cc056fd23fc5ab84b87 commit + making sure auth route always runs through auth token generation is the last commit that uses vite for SPA generation, any after the next.js transition
